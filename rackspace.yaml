  #### Getting Started

  By default redis runs on port 6379 and is configured to listen on all
  interfaces. Authentication is configured and a randomly generated password
  is assigned. The password is available in the `redis_password` output.
  If you want to test with `redis-cli` remember to use the `-a` option
  and supply the password.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
